Fans at the Summer of ‘92 event jammed to their favorite 90’s artists, including Salt N Pepa, En Vogue, Biz Markie, and Lisa Loeb. It was da bomb!<br><br>And it wasn’t just a concert: Terminal 5 got a complete Crystal Pepsi makeover. Guests were able relive the 90’s by cruising the mall for some most excellent gear (no fashion victims here!), get their hair crimped or faded at the Cut & Style Salon, hit the arcade to play The Crystal Pepsi Trail (our version of The Oregon Trail - duh!), or work on their tetherball skills at a special “recess” area. The night was most definitely off the hook."
